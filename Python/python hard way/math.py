print ("i will now count my chickens:")

print ("Hens",25 + 30 / 6)#here we add and divide the no of hens
print ("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)#here we do the same things we calculate the no of roasters
print ("Now i will count the eggs:")
print (3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)#these are the count of eggs which we calculate
print ("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")#here we just ask the question that it is true or not
print (3 + 2 < 5 - 7)#it calculate the values and print that it is true or not
print ("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)#here we doing simple calculation
print ("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)#same thing follows

print ("Oh, That's why it's false.")
print ("How about some more.")

print ("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)#this line is to check the value is greater or not
print ("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)#this line are the same wat we did previous line
print ("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)#same like previous line
